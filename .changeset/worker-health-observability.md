Worker-health observability: surface per-group queue backlog vs. live workers, so "a worker is alive but consuming nothing" stops being silent.

- **transport-bullmq**: a worker stamps a TTL'd liveness heartbeat (`<prefix>-worker-heartbeat:<group>:<instance>`, refreshed every 10s / 35s TTL) while it's consuming — the key expiring is the signal it died or stalled. Mirrors the Python SDK's heartbeat key, so a mixed-language group reports all its workers together. Adds `groupHealth(group)` (queue depth via `getJobCounts` + live workers via a non-blocking `SCAN`) and `listWorkerGroups()` (discovers groups from the heartbeat keyspace).
- **core**: `WorkerHeartbeat`/`GroupHealth` types + an optional `Transport.groupHealth`/`listWorkerGroups`. `WorkflowEngine.workerHealth()` aggregates health across the engine's registered groups (so a registered group with backlog and ZERO workers still reports — the alert case) UNION the groups discovered from live heartbeats (so a local-step group surfaces once its workers beat).
- **dashboard**: a `/workers` API endpoint + a header "Workers" panel — one chip per group showing live-worker count and backlog, turning red on `depth > 0 && liveWorkers === 0`. The Prometheus `/metrics` scrape also emits `durable_group_queue_depth` and `durable_group_live_workers` gauges, so the same signal can drive an alert rule.
