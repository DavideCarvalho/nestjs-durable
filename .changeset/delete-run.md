Add `deleteRun` to hard-delete a run and its rows.

New `StateStore.deleteRun(runId)` removes a run plus its checkpoints, signal waiters, and normalized search-attribute rows — implemented in the in-memory store and all four ORM adapters (mikro-orm, typeorm, prisma, drizzle), forwarded by `CodecStateStore`, and covered by the shared store conformance contract. `WorkflowEngine.deleteRun(runId)` builds on it to hard-delete a run and cascade depth-first to its whole subtree (via `getRunChildren`), returning the number of runs removed.

Unlike `cancel` (which marks a run `cancelled` but keeps it as history), `deleteRun` REMOVES the run — it no longer appears in `getRun`/`listRuns`. Intended for purging a finished run whose data is being deleted; prefer `cancel` first for a live run.
