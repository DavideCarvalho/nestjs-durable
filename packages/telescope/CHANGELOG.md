# @dudousxd/nestjs-durable-telescope

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 4eace00: Observable + adaptive workers. Workers can now self-tune their concurrency and publish a live status
  snapshot on their heartbeat, surfaced per worker in Telescope and the embedded dashboard.

  - **Adaptive concurrency.** The `concurrency` option on every worker surface
    (`BullMQTransport`, `runRedisWorker`, the NestJS in-app worker, the multi-group worker module, and
    the Python `Worker`) now also accepts `'adaptive'` or `{ mode: 'adaptive', min, max, start,
ramCeilingPct, cpuCeilingPct, tickMs }`. A control loop tunes the BullMQ Worker concurrency by an
    AIMD latency-gradient (grows only when saturated, shrinks when latency inflates = queuing), with a
    cgroup-aware RAM ceiling as a hard brake and backpressure on error/stall. A plain number stays
    fixed (default 1) — unchanged. No new dependencies (RAM/CPU read from stdlib + cgroup files).
  - **Worker status on the heartbeat.** The worker-liveness heartbeat value goes from a bare timestamp
    to `{ ts, status }` JSON carrying a `WorkerStatus` (new core type): concurrency mode + live limit,
    in-flight, RSS%, CPU%, throughput/min, p95 latency, and the adaptive controller's last limit change
    (`grow`/`shrink`/`ram_ceiling`/`backpressure`/`cpu_ceiling`). Readers accept both the new JSON and
    the old bare-timestamp form, so a mixed-version fleet reports cleanly.
  - **Telescope + dashboard.** A new `durable.workerStatus` data provider and a "Workers" panel show one
    row per live worker (mode, limit, in-flight/limit saturation, queue depth, RAM%, CPU%, throughput,
    p95, last adjust). The embedded dashboard's worker chips expand to a per-worker breakdown. The
    existing group-level "Worker health" panel is unchanged.

  Note: `@dudousxd/nestjs-durable-transport-bullmq` now depends on `@dudousxd/durable-worker` (it reuses
  the shared adaptive controller). The Python `durable-worker` client gains the same `concurrency`
  knob and status payload (released separately via git tag).

  See `docs/workers-when-to-use.md`.

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- 15437b1: Rename the Workflows dashboard "Starved worker groups" panel to "Worker health".
  The panel lists ALL worker groups (starved sorted first) with a Status column that
  flags STARVED only when a group has queued work and zero live workers — the old
  title read as if every listed group were starved.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 7b8027d: Fix state-breakdown pie palette so each status reads with the semantically-correct color (completed=green, failed=red), aligned index-for-index with the status list.
  Deduplicate triplicated run lifecycle events (the engine emits each event on every pod) by `${event}:${runId}` before aggregating, so throughput, success rate, runs-over-time, timeseries and duration are no longer inflated ~3×.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- c1aaacd: Add a transient `cancelling` run status so a compensating cancel is visible (and durable) instead of looking like a still-`running` run.

  **core:** `RunStatus` gains a non-terminal `'cancelling'`. `cancel(runId, { compensate: true })` now persists `cancelling` immediately (and returns it) while the background saga undo runs, then flips to `cancelled` — previously the run stayed `running`/`suspended` with no outward signal that a cancel was in flight. A repeat compensating cancel is idempotent. The status is treated as in-flight everywhere it must be: the singleton admission gate counts it, and recovery re-drives it — so a crash mid-compensation re-derives the cancel intent from the persisted status and finishes the cancel (a compensating cancel is now crash-durable). A non-compensating `cancel()` is unchanged (straight to `cancelled`). For a remote/polyglot workflow (no TS-side compensations) a `cancelling` run finalizes deterministically to `cancelled`.

  **stores (mikro-orm / typeorm / prisma / drizzle):** `listIncompleteRuns()` now also returns `cancelling` runs so recovery re-drives a compensation interrupted by a crash. Columns are free strings — no migration.

  **dashboard / telescope:** render `cancelling` with a distinct in-progress amber (it pulses like a live run; distinct from the grey terminal `cancelled`), add it to the status filter and the state-breakdown chart.

  **codegen:** generated run-status union types include `'cancelling'`.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 1d76da7: Migrate all internal consumers (engine factory, registrars, timer poller, dashboard service, telescope data providers) to the canonical capability tokens, and flip the dual-bind so the canonical token (`@dudousxd/nestjs-durable:state-store`/`:transport`/`:options`) is the real provider while the legacy `nestjs-durable:*` tokens become `useExisting` back-compat aliases. The legacy tokens are now `@deprecated` but still resolve to the same instances — fully non-breaking.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 687face: Ecosystem improvements across the durable runtime, stores, transports, and tooling.

  ### Scheduling

  - **Schedule jitter + backfill.** Cron/interval schedules can now spread fire
    times with configurable jitter to avoid thundering-herd dispatch, and missed
    occurrences (e.g. while a worker was down) can be backfilled deterministically.

  ### Cancellation

  - **Cancel-by-event.** New `cancelWhere(filter)` cancels all matching runs by a
    declarative filter, complementing single-run cancellation.

  ### Search attributes

  - **Indexed search-attribute side-table pushdown.** Equality and range queries
    over search attributes are pushed down into an indexed side-table across every
    store — TypeORM, MikroORM, Prisma, Drizzle, and the in-memory store — instead
    of scanning and filtering in application code. The side-table is re-indexed on
    update so stale attribute values stop matching.

  ### Singleton admission

  - **Backpressure + notify-on-release + `maxQueueDepth`.** Singleton admission now
    applies backpressure with a configurable `maxQueueDepth`, and waiters are
    notified on release rather than polling.

  ### Queue

  - **Priority + per-key fairness.** The work queue supports per-message priority
    together with per-key fairness so that one busy key cannot starve others.

  ### Context propagation

  - **Opaque context carrier.** Context is now propagated through an opaque carrier,
    decoupling callers from the underlying transport/trace representation.

  ### Packaging

  - **Dual ESM/CJS publish.** Packages now ship both ESM and CJS builds. Decorator
    packages are built via SWC with `legacyDecorator` + `decoratorMetadata` to
    preserve emitted metadata; `testing`, `cli`, and `eslint-plugin` remain
    CJS/ESM as appropriate by design.

  ### Testing

  - **Testcontainers-backed integration specs.** BullMQ, SQS, DB, and Prisma now
    have testcontainers-backed integration specs that run under `test:db`, plus a
    fix to the BullMQ dispatch test shape.

- f14f991: Redesign the Workflows dashboard as golden-signals sections (Health / Needs
  attention / Trends): success-rate gauge, p95 duration + distribution, backlog and
  throughput with trend, top failing workflows, stuck runs, and a state breakdown.
  Requires `@dudousxd/nestjs-telescope` with the enriched panel IR.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3e71141: Surface worker-health on the Telescope "Workflows" dashboard. A new `durable.workerHealth` data provider reads `WorkflowEngine.workerHealth()` (queue depth vs. live worker heartbeats), powering two new panels: a **"Starved groups"** stat (groups with work queued and zero live workers — the "alive but not consuming" alert state) and a **"Worker groups"** table (group · queued · live workers · status, starved first). Complements the `/durable` Workers panel for ops who live in Telescope.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 613f356: Workflows dashboard "Recent failed runs" table is now time-bounded and shows when each failure happened. The `durable.recentFailures` provider only returns failures updated within a window (default 24h; `durableTelescopeExtension({ recentFailuresWindowMs })` to tune, `0` for all) and includes a compact `updatedAt` stamp per row — so a healthy system shows an empty table instead of surfacing days-old failures as if they were a live incident.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 76e9977: Add `durableTelescopeExtension()` — a first-class Telescope extension that adds a native "Workflows" health dashboard. Register it via `TelescopeModule.forRoot({ extensions: [durableTelescopeExtension({ runHref })] })`. It bundles the existing `DurableTelescopeWatcher` plus a `durable.workflows` dashboard (success rate, failed-in-window, current-state gauges for dead/suspended/running/pending, top failing workflows, and a recent-failures table that deep-links each run out to the durable dashboard via `runHref`). Rollups come from the `durable` entries Telescope already captures; current-state gauges read the durable store live via `listRuns`. Requires a `@dudousxd/nestjs-telescope` version that supports the `extensions` option. The standalone `DurableTelescopeWatcher` export is unchanged.
