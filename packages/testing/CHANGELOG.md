## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 99e78fb: Remote `startChild` / `gather_children` child-await `signal:child:` checkpoints now carry the command's `parallelGroup`. The fan group is threaded `command → signal waiter → checkpoint`: the engine stamps each child waiter with the awaiting `startChild` command's group, and the resolving `signal:child:<id>` checkpoint (written when the child notifies the parent) inherits it. Each store adapter persists a nullable `parallel_group` column on the signal-waiter row so it round-trips `put → take`. As a result the dashboard renders a cross-SDK parallel child fan-out (e.g. a Python `ctx.gather_children`) stacked vertically as one parallel group instead of a misleading horizontal `start → s1 → … → sN → end` sequential chain. Additive and backward-compatible: existing waiter rows simply have a NULL group.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- f273457: Dispatch priority now reaches the broker, end-to-end.

  - `ctx.call(step, input, { priority })` and `ctx.child(workflow, input, { priority })` carry their
    priority onto the dispatched `RemoteTask` / `WorkflowTask`. The third arg of `ctx.child` /
    `ctx.startChild` accepts `{ childId?, priority? }` (a bare string is still shorthand for `childId`).
  - The BullMQ transport forwards that priority to the job's `priority` option, translating the
    engine's "higher = more urgent" scale onto BullMQ's inverse "lower = more urgent" so one convention
    holds end-to-end. Jobs without a priority keep the FIFO default path.
  - `WorkflowRun.priority` is persisted by every store adapter (MikroORM, Drizzle, TypeORM, Prisma) so
    the priority survives the store round-trip that precedes each remote-workflow advance. Additive,
    nullable column — auto-schema/self-heal adds it to existing tables.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 39812a2: Add `deleteRun` to hard-delete a run and its rows.

  New `StateStore.deleteRun(runId)` removes a run plus its checkpoints, signal waiters, and normalized search-attribute rows — implemented in the in-memory store and all four ORM adapters (mikro-orm, typeorm, prisma, drizzle), forwarded by `CodecStateStore`, and covered by the shared store conformance contract. `WorkflowEngine.deleteRun(runId)` builds on it to hard-delete a run and cascade depth-first to its whole subtree (via `getRunChildren`), returning the number of runs removed.

  Unlike `cancel` (which marks a run `cancelled` but keeps it as history), `deleteRun` REMOVES the run — it no longer appears in `getRun`/`listRuns`. Intended for purging a finished run whose data is being deleted; prefer `cancel` first for a live run.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 673de96: Make the MikroORM store's physical column naming an explicit, configurable choice instead of an
  implicit dependency on the host ORM's naming strategy.

  The durable entities previously declared no column names, so the physical columns were whatever the
  host MikroORM's naming strategy produced (its default `UnderscoreNamingStrategy` → `snake_case`). The
  TypeORM and Prisma adapters, by contrast, defaulted to the verbatim camelCase property name. Nothing
  pinned the two together, so the adapters silently disagreed on column names — and swapping a deployed
  app from the TypeORM store to the MikroORM store failed at runtime with `Unknown column 'created_at'`
  against the existing (camelCase) table. The divergence was invisible because each adapter's
  conformance suite creates and reads back its _own_ schema.

  `@dudousxd/nestjs-durable-store-mikro-orm` now exposes `durableEntities({ naming })`, which pins
  explicit column names onto the entity schemas per the chosen convention:

  - `'snake_case'` (default) — the canonical convention, matching the Drizzle adapter.
  - `'preserve'` — the verbatim camelCase property name, for an app whose tables were created by the
    old TypeORM/Prisma adapter and that wants to swap to the MikroORM store with **no migration**.
  - a `(property) => string` function for any custom mapping.

  `ENTITIES` is unchanged in spirit — it is now `durableEntities()` (canonical `snake_case`). The store
  keeps resolving column names from ORM metadata, so it adapts to whichever naming the entities were
  registered with.

  `@dudousxd/nestjs-durable-testing` adds `DURABLE_CANONICAL_COLUMNS` (the canonical snake_case column
  contract) and `assertDurableColumns()` — the cross-adapter guard the project lacked. Each adapter can
  now assert its physical columns against one source of truth, so a future divergence is a failing unit
  test instead of a production "Unknown column".

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- b7267da: perf: `getEvent` and `getRunChildren` use targeted store queries instead of fetching and JS-filtering every checkpoint for a run. Adds two **optional** `StateStore` methods (`getLatestCheckpointByName`, `listCheckpointsByNamePrefix`) implemented by all first-party adapters; the engine falls back to the previous `listCheckpoints` scan when a custom store omits them, so this is non-breaking. Cuts per-call rows fetched from O(N) to O(1)/O(k).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 687face: Ecosystem improvements across the durable runtime, stores, transports, and tooling.

  ### Scheduling

  - **Schedule jitter + backfill.** Cron/interval schedules can now spread fire
    times with configurable jitter to avoid thundering-herd dispatch, and missed
    occurrences (e.g. while a worker was down) can be backfilled deterministically.

  ### Cancellation

  - **Cancel-by-event.** New `cancelWhere(filter)` cancels all matching runs by a
    declarative filter, complementing single-run cancellation.

  ### Search attributes

  - **Indexed search-attribute side-table pushdown.** Equality and range queries
    over search attributes are pushed down into an indexed side-table across every
    store — TypeORM, MikroORM, Prisma, Drizzle, and the in-memory store — instead
    of scanning and filtering in application code. The side-table is re-indexed on
    update so stale attribute values stop matching.

  ### Singleton admission

  - **Backpressure + notify-on-release + `maxQueueDepth`.** Singleton admission now
    applies backpressure with a configurable `maxQueueDepth`, and waiters are
    notified on release rather than polling.

  ### Queue

  - **Priority + per-key fairness.** The work queue supports per-message priority
    together with per-key fairness so that one busy key cannot starve others.

  ### Context propagation

  - **Opaque context carrier.** Context is now propagated through an opaque carrier,
    decoupling callers from the underlying transport/trace representation.

  ### Packaging

  - **Dual ESM/CJS publish.** Packages now ship both ESM and CJS builds. Decorator
    packages are built via SWC with `legacyDecorator` + `decoratorMetadata` to
    preserve emitted metadata; `testing`, `cli`, and `eslint-plugin` remain
    CJS/ESM as appropriate by design.

  ### Testing

  - **Testcontainers-backed integration specs.** BullMQ, SQS, DB, and Prisma now
    have testcontainers-backed integration specs that run under `test:db`, plus a
    fix to the BullMQ dispatch test shape.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a5fd901: **Breaking (0.x minor): `start` now dispatches to a worker instead of running the workflow inline.**

  Previously `engine.start` / `WorkflowService.start` executed the workflow body inline and returned the terminal `RunResult`. Now `start` only **enqueues**: it creates the run as a new `'pending'` status, hands it to a `RunDispatcher`, and returns `{ runId, status: 'pending' }` immediately — the body runs on a worker, so the caller (e.g. an HTTP handler) never blocks on workflow logic.

  **Migration**

  - To await the outcome, use the new `engine.waitForRun(runId)` / `workflowService.waitForRun(runId)` — resolves once the run settles (terminal or suspended). `const { runId } = await start(...); const result = await waitForRun(runId)`.
  - **Default behavior is unchanged for single-process apps**: the default in-process dispatcher executes the run on the same instance (asynchronously), so runs still execute with no extra setup.
  - **Offload to workers**: pass a no-op `runDispatcher` on API/dashboard instances (or set NestJS `worker: false`) so they enqueue-only; worker instances poll `engine.runPending()` (the NestJS `TimerPoller` now does this each tick) to pick up `pending` runs. A broker-backed dispatcher can enqueue to a queue whose workers call `engine.runOne(runId)`.

  New: `RunStatus` gains `'pending'`; engine gains `runOne`, `runPending`, `waitForRun`; `WorkflowEngineDeps.runDispatcher`. The testing harness gains `createTestEngine().run(...)` (start + wait) and the dashboard shows the `pending` state. `StateStore` gains `listPendingRuns(limit)` (oldest-first / FIFO) — **custom store implementations must add it** (all bundled adapters do).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Durability hardening (audit follow-up):
  - **Non-determinism detection**: on resume, a step whose name no longer matches the checkpoint recorded at that logical position throws `NonDeterminismError` instead of silently replaying the wrong checkpoint into the wrong step (the classic way a changed-under-flight workflow corrupts a run).
  - **Deterministic sources**: `ctx.now()`, `ctx.random()`, `ctx.uuid()` — checkpointed once and replayed verbatim, so workflows stop being corrupted by raw `Date.now()`/`Math.random()`/`randomUUID()`.
  - **Retry backoff**: `StepOptions` `backoff: 'fixed' | 'exp'` + `backoffMs`/`backoffMaxMs`/`jitter` is now actually applied between local-step retries (it was declared but ignored).
  - **Cancellation safety**: a cancelled/completed run is no longer re-executed by a late worker result or a duplicate `resume()`.
  - **testing**: `assertReplayable(register, history)` replays a recorded run's history against the current workflow code and throws on divergence — a CI guard that catches non-determinism before deploy.
  - **otel**: failed steps now emit a span (with error status), not just completed ones.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- `ctx.call` now **suspends the run durably** instead of awaiting the worker result in memory. The
  remote step writes a `pending` checkpoint, the run suspends, and the result resumes it on whichever
  engine instance receives it — so a worker/control-plane pod can scale down or crash mid-step without
  losing the run or re-running completed work. This makes `ctx.call` consistent with `ctx.task` /
  `ctx.sleep` (already durable). A step that sets `timeoutMs` keeps the in-memory await + heartbeat path
  (opt-in liveness, single-instance).

  **Breaking:** `engine.start()` / `WorkflowService.start()` now returns `suspended` (not `completed`)
  for a workflow that hits a remote `ctx.call` — the run finishes asynchronously when the result lands.
  Trigger-and-observe consumers are unaffected; anything that awaited `start()` to completion should
  poll the run status (or react to `run.completed`) instead.

  `StepCheckpoint.status` gains `'pending'` (an in-flight remote step), surfaced in the dashboard as a
  "running" node. In-process transports (event-emitter, the in-memory test transport) now deliver
  results on a later tick so the suspend settles first.
