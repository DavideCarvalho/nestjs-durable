## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 4762866: **Breaking: `start` now dispatches to a worker instead of running the workflow inline.**

  Previously `engine.start` / `WorkflowService.start` executed the workflow body inline and returned the terminal `RunResult`. Now `start` only **enqueues**: it creates the run as a new `'pending'` status, hands it to a `RunDispatcher`, and returns `{ runId, status: 'pending' }` immediately — the body runs on a worker, so the caller (e.g. an HTTP handler) never blocks on workflow logic.

  **Migration**

  - To await the outcome, use the new `engine.waitForRun(runId)` / `workflowService.waitForRun(runId)` — resolves once the run settles (terminal or suspended). `const { runId } = await start(...); const result = await waitForRun(runId)`.
  - **Default behavior is unchanged for single-process apps**: the default in-process dispatcher executes the run on the same instance (asynchronously), so runs still execute with no extra setup.
  - **Offload to workers**: pass a no-op `runDispatcher` on API/dashboard instances (or set NestJS `worker: false`) so they enqueue-only; worker instances poll `engine.runPending()` (the NestJS `TimerPoller` now does this each tick) to pick up `pending` runs. A broker-backed dispatcher can enqueue to a queue whose workers call `engine.runOne(runId)`.

  New: `RunStatus` gains `'pending'`; engine gains `runOne`, `runPending`, `waitForRun`; `WorkflowEngineDeps.runDispatcher`. The testing harness gains `createTestEngine().run(...)` (start + wait) and the dashboard shows the `pending` state. `StateStore` gains `listPendingRuns(limit)` (oldest-first / FIFO) — **custom store implementations must add it** (all bundled adapters do).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Durability hardening (audit follow-up):
  - **Non-determinism detection**: on resume, a step whose name no longer matches the checkpoint recorded at that logical position throws `NonDeterminismError` instead of silently replaying the wrong checkpoint into the wrong step (the classic way a changed-under-flight workflow corrupts a run).
  - **Deterministic sources**: `ctx.now()`, `ctx.random()`, `ctx.uuid()` — checkpointed once and replayed verbatim, so workflows stop being corrupted by raw `Date.now()`/`Math.random()`/`randomUUID()`.
  - **Retry backoff**: `StepOptions` `backoff: 'fixed' | 'exp'` + `backoffMs`/`backoffMaxMs`/`jitter` is now actually applied between local-step retries (it was declared but ignored).
  - **Cancellation safety**: a cancelled/completed run is no longer re-executed by a late worker result or a duplicate `resume()`.
  - **testing**: `assertReplayable(register, history)` replays a recorded run's history against the current workflow code and throws on divergence — a CI guard that catches non-determinism before deploy.
  - **otel**: failed steps now emit a span (with error status), not just completed ones.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- `ctx.call` now **suspends the run durably** instead of awaiting the worker result in memory. The
  remote step writes a `pending` checkpoint, the run suspends, and the result resumes it on whichever
  engine instance receives it — so a worker/control-plane pod can scale down or crash mid-step without
  losing the run or re-running completed work. This makes `ctx.call` consistent with `ctx.task` /
  `ctx.sleep` (already durable). A step that sets `timeoutMs` keeps the in-memory await + heartbeat path
  (opt-in liveness, single-instance).

  **Breaking:** `engine.start()` / `WorkflowService.start()` now returns `suspended` (not `completed`)
  for a workflow that hits a remote `ctx.call` — the run finishes asynchronously when the result lands.
  Trigger-and-observe consumers are unaffected; anything that awaited `start()` to completion should
  poll the run status (or react to `run.completed`) instead.

  `StepCheckpoint.status` gains `'pending'` (an in-flight remote step), surfaced in the dashboard as a
  "running" node. In-process transports (event-emitter, the in-memory test transport) now deliver
  results on a later tick so the suspend settles first.
