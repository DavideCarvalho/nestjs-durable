 * Replay a recorded run's history against the CURRENT workflow code and throw if they diverged.
 *
 * Capture a real (ideally in-flight or representative) run from production —
 * `{ run: await store.getRun(id), checkpoints: await store.listCheckpoints(id) }` — commit it as a
 * fixture, and assert here in CI. If a code change renamed/reordered/removed a step at a position the
 * history already recorded, the engine raises a `NonDeterminismError` on replay and this rethrows it,
 * catching the break *before* it reaches an in-flight run on deploy (the moment you'd otherwise
 * silently replay the wrong checkpoint into the wrong step). Register the workflow exactly as the app
 * does:
 *
 * ```ts
 * await assertReplayable((engine) => engine.register('pipeline', '1', pipeline.run), fixture);
