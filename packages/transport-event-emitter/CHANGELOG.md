# @dudousxd/nestjs-durable-transport-event-emitter

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 687face: Ecosystem improvements across the durable runtime, stores, transports, and tooling.

  ### Scheduling

  - **Schedule jitter + backfill.** Cron/interval schedules can now spread fire
    times with configurable jitter to avoid thundering-herd dispatch, and missed
    occurrences (e.g. while a worker was down) can be backfilled deterministically.

  ### Cancellation

  - **Cancel-by-event.** New `cancelWhere(filter)` cancels all matching runs by a
    declarative filter, complementing single-run cancellation.

  ### Search attributes

  - **Indexed search-attribute side-table pushdown.** Equality and range queries
    over search attributes are pushed down into an indexed side-table across every
    store — TypeORM, MikroORM, Prisma, Drizzle, and the in-memory store — instead
    of scanning and filtering in application code. The side-table is re-indexed on
    update so stale attribute values stop matching.

  ### Singleton admission

  - **Backpressure + notify-on-release + `maxQueueDepth`.** Singleton admission now
    applies backpressure with a configurable `maxQueueDepth`, and waiters are
    notified on release rather than polling.

  ### Queue

  - **Priority + per-key fairness.** The work queue supports per-message priority
    together with per-key fairness so that one busy key cannot starve others.

  ### Context propagation

  - **Opaque context carrier.** Context is now propagated through an opaque carrier,
    decoupling callers from the underlying transport/trace representation.

  ### Packaging

  - **Dual ESM/CJS publish.** Packages now ship both ESM and CJS builds. Decorator
    packages are built via SWC with `legacyDecorator` + `decoratorMetadata` to
    preserve emitted metadata; `testing`, `cli`, and `eslint-plugin` remain
    CJS/ESM as appropriate by design.

  ### Testing

  - **Testcontainers-backed integration specs.** BullMQ, SQS, DB, and Prisma now
    have testcontainers-backed integration specs that run under `test:db`, plus a
    fix to the BullMQ dispatch test shape.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 6836ace: refactor!: separate the control plane from the Transport

  `publishControl`/`onControl` are no longer part of `Transport`; they form a dedicated `ControlPlane`
  interface, and the engine takes a separate `controlPlane` dependency. This decouples cross-instance
  broadcast (lifecycle events + cancellation) from the point-to-point task transport, so you can run a
  dedicated control plane (e.g. Redis pub/sub) independent of how steps are dispatched. Broadcast-capable
  transports (event-emitter, BullMQ) implement `ControlPlane` too and can be passed as both; the NestJS
  module auto-wires the transport as the control plane when it qualifies, or accepts an explicit
  `controlPlane` option.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- **Transport control plane** — a broadcast pub/sub across all engine instances, unlocking the cross-pod features from the durability audit:

  - `Transport.publishControl(msg)` / `onControl(handler)` + a `ControlMessage` type. In-process transports (in-memory, event-emitter) broadcast locally; **BullMQ broadcasts over Redis pub/sub**. Optional — the engine degrades to local-only when a transport doesn't implement it.
  - **Cross-pod live-tail**: the engine now broadcasts lifecycle events, so a dashboard-only pod (`worker: false`) sees events from a run executing on a worker pod. The dashboard exposes `@Sse('runs/:id/stream')` and `durableClient.streamRun(id, onEvent)` — live updates without polling.
  - **Cooperative cancellation**: `engine.cancel(runId)` broadcasts the cancel; `engine.onCancel(fn)` lets a worker bridge abort in-flight work instead of finishing it just to have the result discarded. Events are deduped by originating `instanceId` so a broker echo doesn't double-deliver.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- `ctx.call` now **suspends the run durably** instead of awaiting the worker result in memory. The
  remote step writes a `pending` checkpoint, the run suspends, and the result resumes it on whichever
  engine instance receives it — so a worker/control-plane pod can scale down or crash mid-step without
  losing the run or re-running completed work. This makes `ctx.call` consistent with `ctx.task` /
  `ctx.sleep` (already durable). A step that sets `timeoutMs` keeps the in-memory await + heartbeat path
  (opt-in liveness, single-instance).

  **Breaking:** `engine.start()` / `WorkflowService.start()` now returns `suspended` (not `completed`)
  for a workflow that hits a remote `ctx.call` — the run finishes asynchronously when the result lands.
  Trigger-and-observe consumers are unaffected; anything that awaited `start()` to completion should
  poll the run status (or react to `run.completed`) instead.

  `StepCheckpoint.status` gains `'pending'` (an in-flight remote step), surfaced in the dashboard as a
  "running" node. In-process transports (event-emitter, the in-memory test transport) now deliver
  results on a later tick so the suspend settles first.
