## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 6836ace: refactor!: separate the control plane from the Transport

  `publishControl`/`onControl` are no longer part of `Transport`; they form a dedicated `ControlPlane`
  interface, and the engine takes a separate `controlPlane` dependency. This decouples cross-instance
  broadcast (lifecycle events + cancellation) from the point-to-point task transport, so you can run a
  dedicated control plane (e.g. Redis pub/sub) independent of how steps are dispatched. Broadcast-capable
  transports (event-emitter, BullMQ) implement `ControlPlane` too and can be passed as both; the NestJS
  module auto-wires the transport as the control plane when it qualifies, or accepts an explicit
  `controlPlane` option.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- **Transport control plane** — a broadcast pub/sub across all engine instances, unlocking the cross-pod features from the durability audit:

  - `Transport.publishControl(msg)` / `onControl(handler)` + a `ControlMessage` type. In-process transports (in-memory, event-emitter) broadcast locally; **BullMQ broadcasts over Redis pub/sub**. Optional — the engine degrades to local-only when a transport doesn't implement it.
  - **Cross-pod live-tail**: the engine now broadcasts lifecycle events, so a dashboard-only pod (`worker: false`) sees events from a run executing on a worker pod. The dashboard exposes `@Sse('runs/:id/stream')` and `durableClient.streamRun(id, onEvent)` — live updates without polling.
  - **Cooperative cancellation**: `engine.cancel(runId)` broadcasts the cancel; `engine.onCancel(fn)` lets a worker bridge abort in-flight work instead of finishing it just to have the result discarded. Events are deduped by originating `instanceId` so a broker echo doesn't double-deliver.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- `ctx.call` now **suspends the run durably** instead of awaiting the worker result in memory. The
  remote step writes a `pending` checkpoint, the run suspends, and the result resumes it on whichever
  engine instance receives it — so a worker/control-plane pod can scale down or crash mid-step without
  losing the run or re-running completed work. This makes `ctx.call` consistent with `ctx.task` /
  `ctx.sleep` (already durable). A step that sets `timeoutMs` keeps the in-memory await + heartbeat path
  (opt-in liveness, single-instance).

  **Breaking:** `engine.start()` / `WorkflowService.start()` now returns `suspended` (not `completed`)
  for a workflow that hits a remote `ctx.call` — the run finishes asynchronously when the result lands.
  Trigger-and-observe consumers are unaffected; anything that awaited `start()` to completion should
  poll the run status (or react to `run.completed`) instead.

  `StepCheckpoint.status` gains `'pending'` (an in-flight remote step), surfaced in the dashboard as a
  "running" node. In-process transports (event-emitter, the in-memory test transport) now deliver
  results on a later tick so the suspend settles first.
