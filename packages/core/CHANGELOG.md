## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 4762866: **Breaking: `start` now dispatches to a worker instead of running the workflow inline.**

  Previously `engine.start` / `WorkflowService.start` executed the workflow body inline and returned the terminal `RunResult`. Now `start` only **enqueues**: it creates the run as a new `'pending'` status, hands it to a `RunDispatcher`, and returns `{ runId, status: 'pending' }` immediately — the body runs on a worker, so the caller (e.g. an HTTP handler) never blocks on workflow logic.

  **Migration**

  - To await the outcome, use the new `engine.waitForRun(runId)` / `workflowService.waitForRun(runId)` — resolves once the run settles (terminal or suspended). `const { runId } = await start(...); const result = await waitForRun(runId)`.
  - **Default behavior is unchanged for single-process apps**: the default in-process dispatcher executes the run on the same instance (asynchronously), so runs still execute with no extra setup.
  - **Offload to workers**: pass a no-op `runDispatcher` on API/dashboard instances (or set NestJS `worker: false`) so they enqueue-only; worker instances poll `engine.runPending()` (the NestJS `TimerPoller` now does this each tick) to pick up `pending` runs. A broker-backed dispatcher can enqueue to a queue whose workers call `engine.runOne(runId)`.

  New: `RunStatus` gains `'pending'`; engine gains `runOne`, `runPending`, `waitForRun`; `WorkflowEngineDeps.runDispatcher`. The testing harness gains `createTestEngine().run(...)` (start + wait) and the dashboard shows the `pending` state. `StateStore` gains `listPendingRuns(limit)` (oldest-first / FIFO) — **custom store implementations must add it** (all bundled adapters do).

### Minor Changes

- c648786: Event-triggered workflows: a workflow can now **start** on a published event, not just wait for one.

  - **Core**: `engine.register(name, version, fn, { onEvent: ['user.registered'] })` — `publishEvent(name, payload, { id })` now starts a fresh run of every subscribed workflow (payload becomes the input) in addition to resuming `waitForEvent` waiters. Idempotent by `evt:<id>:<workflow>`; the return count includes both resumed and started runs.
  - **NestJS**: `@Workflow({ onEvent: [...] })` **or** a dedicated `@OnEvent('a', 'b')` class decorator (listen to several events; both forms merge). `workflowService.publishEvent(name, payload, { id })` gained the dedup id.

- f1e7999: Input validation at workflow start. The engine now rejects a bad payload **before any run is created**, so invalid input never produces a dead/failed run.

  - **Core** (validator-agnostic): `engine.register(name, version, fn, { validateInput })` — a `(input) => void | Promise<void>` that throws to reject.
  - **NestJS** (class-validator, the controller default): `@Workflow({ inputSchema: CheckoutInput })` validates with the same `plainToInstance` + `validate` NestJS runs in controllers. `class-validator` + `class-transformer` are lazy-required optional peers. For zod/yup/etc. pass `@Workflow({ validateInput })` instead (it wins over `inputSchema`).

- f1679e5: Typed search attributes — query runs by structured data, not just exact-match tag labels.

  - **Start**: `start(wf, input, id, { searchAttributes: { amount: 200, tier: 'pro' } })` stamps typed, queryable data on a run.
  - **Query**: `RunQuery.attributes` takes `{ key, op, value }` predicates ANDed together, with `eq/ne/gt/gte/lt/lte` — so range queries like `amount >= 200 AND tier = 'pro'` work. Applied in-process after the coarse workflow/status/tag filters, so it's portable across all store adapters (typeorm/prisma/mikro-orm/drizzle gain a `searchAttributes` JSON column).
  - **Dashboard**: an attribute filter box (`amount:gte:200, tier:eq:pro`), attribute pills on the run detail, and bulk retry/cancel honoring the same predicates. API: `GET /runs?attr=key:op:value` (repeatable).

- 46c293b: Step interceptors — onion middleware around the real execution of every local `ctx.step` (timing, logging, tracing, error enrichment, context propagation). They fire **only when a step actually executes, never on replay**, so timing/metrics reflect true work.

  - **Core**: `engine.use((invocation, next) => ...)` — `invocation` carries `{ runId, workflow, stepName, seq, attempt }`; `next()` runs the step body / next interceptor and returns its result. First registered is outermost. Returns an unsubscribe.
  - **NestJS**: `@StepInterceptor()` on an `@Injectable()` class implementing `DurableStepInterceptor` (so it can inject loggers/tracers). Discovered and wired on boot.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- f2260da: feat: named events — ctx.waitForEvent + engine.publishEvent

  Name-based pub/sub on top of the signal machinery, for choreography beyond point-to-point signals. A
  run suspends on `ctx.waitForEvent('payment.settled', { match: { orderId }, timeoutMs })` and resumes
  with the payload; `engine.publishEvent(name, payload)` (also `WorkflowService.publishEvent`) fans out
  to every waiting run whose `match` the payload satisfies, returning how many it resumed. The match is
  encoded in the waiter token, so the only store change is a new `listSignalWaiters(prefix)` method
  (implemented across in-memory, TypeORM, MikroORM, Prisma, Drizzle) — no new schema.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- c3398be: feat: executionTimeout — cap a run's wall-clock lifetime

  `@Workflow({ executionTimeout: '2h' })` (or ms) moves a run to `cancelled` (`execution_timeout`) once
  it outlives the budget — a backstop for runs that get stuck or loop forever. Enforced by a new
  `engine.sweepTimeouts(now)` the timer poller calls each tick (over the existing workflow+status query;
  no new schema). The terminal `cancelled` state means a late step result can't resurrect it.

- 8b87a16: feat(scheduler): pause + overlap policy

  `ScheduledWorkflow` gains two controls:

  - **`paused`** — temporarily stop firing a schedule (kept registered).
  - **`overlap: 'skip'`** (fixed-interval) — skip a window while the previous window's run is still
    `running`/`suspended`, so a slow run can't pile up overlapping executions (default `'allow'`).

  Also adds a public `engine.getRun(runId)` pass-through.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 12c91ff: feat: Prometheus metrics

  `collectMetrics(engine)` subscribes to the engine's lifecycle events and accumulates dependency-free
  counters — runs + steps by outcome, per-workflow run counts, step-duration sum/count. Call
  `.prometheus()` for the text exposition or `.snapshot()` for raw numbers. The dashboard wires it
  automatically and serves it at `GET <apiBasePath>/metrics` for a scrape.

- 4fb5f90: feat: CodecStateStore — encrypt / compress / redact payloads at rest

  A `StateStore` decorator that runs run/step **payloads** (input + output) through a `PayloadCodec`
  (encode on write, decode on read), so they're never stored in the clear — for at-rest encryption,
  compression, or PII redaction. Adapter-agnostic (`new CodecStateStore(innerStore, codec)`).
  Searchable metadata (id, status, workflow, tags, timestamps) and the structured `error` are left
  untouched so the dashboard, queries, and recovery keep working.

- bc4539d: feat: singleton — serialize runs by key (durable FIFO mutex)

  `@Workflow({ singleton: { key: (input) => `base:${input.baseId}` } })` runs at most one run per key
  at a time (e.g. one pipeline per base). Same-key runs queue — suspended, admitted in creation order
  as slots free — instead of running concurrently. `limit` (default 1) raises the concurrency. Race-free
  and FIFO on a consistent store: admission is the same `(createdAt, id)` view for every engine instance,
  implemented over the existing tag+status query (no new schema). Also exposed as
  `engine.register(name, version, fn, { singleton })`.

- b72c20f: feat: ctx.sleepUntil + ctx.continueAsNew

  - **`ctx.sleepUntil(date | epochMs)`** — durable sleep to an absolute deadline (e.g. "resume at
    midnight"), the absolute-time counterpart of `ctx.sleep(duration)`. Replay-stable.
  - **`ctx.continueAsNew(input?)`** — end the current run and hand off to a fresh execution of the same
    workflow with a clean history, for long-running / looping workflows that would otherwise accumulate
    unbounded checkpoints. The next run gets id `<runId>~N`; the handoff is idempotent by that id.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 685258f: feat: workflow tags + search

  Label runs and search/filter by them in the dashboard. Tags come from two sources, merged onto each
  run:

  - **Static** — `@Workflow({ name: 'pipeline', tags: ['etl', 'critical'] })` stamps every run of the
    workflow.
  - **Per-run** — `WorkflowService.start(wf, input, runId, { tags: ['nightly'] })` (and
    `engine.start(..., { tags })`) adds run-scoped tags.

  `WorkflowRun.tags` is stored across all store adapters (in-memory, TypeORM, MikroORM, Prisma,
  Drizzle), and `RunQuery.tag` filters by an exact tag. The dashboard shows tags on each run (list +
  detail) and adds a tag filter box; clicking a tag filters the list. The dashboard API gains a
  `?tag=` query param.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 6979d60: fix: list runs newest-first

  `store.listRuns` now orders by `createdAt DESC` (was `ASC`) across every adapter (in-memory,
  TypeORM, MikroORM, Prisma, Drizzle), so the dashboard shows the most recent run on top instead of
  buried at the bottom.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 2addfd2: feat: pass workflow **classes** instead of name strings, and a fire-and-forget `ctx.startChild`

  **Workflow class refs.** Anywhere you named a workflow by string, you can now pass its class for a
  same-runtime call — refactor-safe and typed — while strings stay for cross-runtime (e.g. a Python
  workflow):

  - `ctx.child(ShippingWorkflow, input)` — input is type-checked and the result is inferred from the
    child's `run` (no manual type parameter).
  - `engine.start(CheckoutWorkflow, input)` / `WorkflowService.start(CheckoutWorkflow, input)`.
  - `@Workflow({ deadLetterWorkflow: PipelineDlqWorkflow })` and the module-level `deadLetterWorkflow`.

  The `@Workflow` decorator stamps the registered name on the class; `workflowName(ref)` (exported)
  resolves a `WorkflowRef` (`string | WorkflowClass`) back to its name. New exported types:
  `WorkflowClass`, `WorkflowRef`, `WorkflowInputOf`, `WorkflowOutputOf`, and `WORKFLOW_NAME_KEY`.

  **`ctx.startChild`.** A fire-and-forget counterpart to `ctx.child`: dispatches a child once
  (checkpointed, replay-safe) and returns its run id immediately instead of suspending — for side work
  the parent doesn't wait on, or scatter-gather (start many, then `ctx.child` each by the same id to
  join; the start is idempotent by id, so each child runs exactly once).

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e9799ca: feat: dead-letter handler — `engine.onDead` + `deadLetterWorkflow`

  Dead-lettering is no longer only "park the run in `dead`". `engine.onDead((run) => …)` fires when a
  run is moved to `dead` (exceeded `maxRecoveryAttempts`), so a DLQ handler can alert, push to a real
  queue, or compensate. The NestJS module adds a `deadLetterWorkflow` option that routes a dead run to
  a designated workflow with `{ deadRunId, workflow, input, error }` (idempotent by a `dlq:<runId>` id).
  Omitting both keeps the prior behaviour (the run stays parked, inspectable + retriable).

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 0900830: feat: compensating cancellation — `engine.cancel(runId, { compensate: true })`

  Cancelling a run can now undo its saga first: the suspended run is resumed with a cancellation
  pending, so replay re-registers the saga and its completed steps' compensations run in reverse
  (visible as `compensate:<step>` events) before the run is marked cancelled. Plain `cancel()` is
  unchanged (immediate, no undo). The dashboard's cancel accepts `?compensate=true`
  (`durableClient.cancel(id, { compensate: true })`), and the codegen client exposes the flag.

- df6524f: feat: cron + timezone schedules

  `ScheduledWorkflow` now accepts a `cron` expression with an IANA `timezone` (DST-aware) as an
  alternative to the fixed-interval `everyMs`. The run id is keyed on the most recent fire time, so
  polling repeatedly within an interval — or racing instances on the same tick — starts each fire
  exactly once (idempotent). The NestJS module gains a `schedules` option; the timer poller fires them
  each tick on **worker** instances only. Cron evaluation uses the optional `cron-parser` peer
  dependency, so the core stays dependency-free for users who don't schedule by cron.

- 9f9767e: feat: `ctx.patched(id)` — guard in-place workflow changes

  Migrate a workflow without registering a new version: wrap the changed code in
  `if (await ctx.patched('my-change')) { …new… } else { …old… }`. A fresh run records a `patch:<id>`
  marker and takes the new branch; a run already recorded under the old code keeps the old branch,
  because the marker is **position-transparent** for it (it rolls the logical position back when the
  recorded history has a real step where the marker would sit) — so guarding code never shifts an
  in-flight run's checkpoints and can't corrupt replay. Remove the guard once old runs have drained.

- 3f79533: feat: dead-letter queue — `maxRecoveryAttempts` + `dead` run status

  Crash recovery now counts attempts per run (`WorkflowRun.recoveryAttempts`); once a still-`running`
  run exceeds the engine/module `maxRecoveryAttempts`, it's moved to the new terminal **`dead`** status
  instead of being retried forever — so a poison pill that crashes the process every boot becomes an
  inspectable dead-letter entry, not a crash loop. The new column is persisted by all four store
  adapters (TypeORM auto-schema self-heals it; Prisma/Drizzle/MikroORM schemas updated), and `dead` is
  added to the dashboard/codegen status unions. Omit `maxRecoveryAttempts` for the prior unlimited-retry behaviour.

- fb8a12b: feat: retry with backoff on the durable remote path

  A durable `ctx.call` (no `timeoutMs`) now re-dispatches a **failed** remote step up to `retries`,
  spacing attempts by the configured `backoff`/`backoffMs` — the retry deadline is stamped on the
  failed checkpoint as `wakeAt` (clock-space, persisted), so it's stable across replays and survives a
  crash. A worker can opt out per-failure by throwing an error with `retryable: false` (now carried
  through the wire by the step runner, alongside `code`), which the engine treats as a final verdict.

- 9c4a3cf: feat: durable webhooks (`ctx.webhook()`)

  A first-class, replay-safe "expose a callback URL and wait for it" primitive. `ctx.webhook()` mints
  a deterministic token (`wh:<runId>:<seq>`) and — when the engine has a `webhookUrl` builder — a
  public `url` to hand a third party inside a step; `await handle.wait()` then suspends with zero
  compute until the callback arrives. The dashboard exposes `POST webhooks/:token` (turning the inbound
  POST into `engine.signal`), the NestJS module gains a `webhookUrl` option, and the codegen extension
  emits the `deliverWebhook` (and the previously-missing `continue`) route into the typed client.

- fc9764c: feat: flow control — durable queues for remote steps

  `engine.registerQueue({ name, concurrency, rateLimit })` (or the NestJS module's `queues` option)
  caps how much work `ctx.call(step, input, { queue })` admits at once — a concurrency limit and/or a
  fixed-window rate limit. A call that can't be admitted does **not** dispatch: the run re-suspends
  with the queue's retry time and the timer poller re-tries admission later, so the limit is durable
  (survives crashes) without holding the run in memory. Accounting is per engine instance (the DBOS
  `workerConcurrency` tier); global cross-instance limits remain a follow-up needing a durable counter.

- 7c50198: feat: multiple transports with failover + per-step selection

  The engine now accepts an ordered `transports` pool (`[{ id, transport }]`): it dispatches on the
  first and **fails over to the next on a dispatch error**, and a step can pin one with
  `ctx.call(step, input, { transport: 'sqs' })`. The chosen transport id is stamped on the
  `RemoteTask` (`task.transport`) so a worker that consumes several transports replies on the matching
  one — failover stays symmetric without the worker ever choosing a transport. Results/heartbeats are
  consumed from every transport in the pool. `transport` (single) remains as shorthand for a one-entry
  pool; the NestJS module exposes `transports`. Cross-language note: run one worker/runner per broker
  and the matching one handles each failover hop and replies on its own broker — no worker change
  needed; `task.transport` is there for processes that multiplex brokers.

- 9e36ac0: feat: saga compensation retry + visibility, and a dashboard query index

  - **Compensation retry + visibility** — each saga undo is now retried up to `compensationRetries`
    (engine/module option, default 1) and emits a `compensate:<step>` step event for its outcome, so a
    stranded undo shows up in the dashboard/telescope instead of being silently swallowed. A
    permanently-failing compensation is still skipped so it can't mask the original failure.
  - **TypeORM auto-schema index** — adds `(workflow, status)` alongside the existing `(status, wakeAt)`
    index, so the dashboard's `listRuns` filter hits an index.

- f915e2c: feat: synchronous queries & validated updates

  Two Temporal-style primitives adapted to the suspend/checkpoint model:

  - **Query** — `ctx.setEvent(key, value)` publishes a named, replay-safe value; `engine.getEvent(runId, key)`
    reads the latest value of a live (or finished) run with no side effect. Exposed as
    `GET runs/:id/events/:key`.
  - **Update** — `ctx.onUpdate(name)` is a run-scoped update point; `engine.update(runId, name, arg)`
    delivers to it, gated by a validator registered with `engine.registerUpdateValidator(workflow, name, fn)`
    that can **reject before the run is touched** (`{ accepted: false, reason }`). Exposed as
    `POST runs/:id/updates/:name`. The codegen extension emits both routes into the typed client.

- 6836ace: refactor!: separate the control plane from the Transport

  `publishControl`/`onControl` are no longer part of `Transport`; they form a dedicated `ControlPlane`
  interface, and the engine takes a separate `controlPlane` dependency. This decouples cross-instance
  broadcast (lifecycle events + cancellation) from the point-to-point task transport, so you can run a
  dedicated control plane (e.g. Redis pub/sub) independent of how steps are dispatched. Broadcast-capable
  transports (event-emitter, BullMQ) implement `ControlPlane` too and can be passed as both; the NestJS
  module auto-wires the transport as the control plane when it qualifies, or accepts an explicit
  `controlPlane` option.

- 6b36ffa: feat: propagate W3C traceparent to workers (distributed tracing)

  The engine now stamps a `traceparent` on every dispatched `RemoteTask` from an optional
  `traceparent` provider, so a worker (including the Python SDK) can continue the distributed trace
  instead of starting a detached one. Core stays OTel-free: the otel package exports `otelTraceparent()`
  (reads the active span via the registered W3C propagator) to wire in —
  `new WorkflowEngine({ traceparent: () => otelTraceparent() })` — and the NestJS module exposes a
  `traceparent` option. The wire field already existed; this populates it.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- **Transport control plane** — a broadcast pub/sub across all engine instances, unlocking the cross-pod features from the durability audit:

  - `Transport.publishControl(msg)` / `onControl(handler)` + a `ControlMessage` type. In-process transports (in-memory, event-emitter) broadcast locally; **BullMQ broadcasts over Redis pub/sub**. Optional — the engine degrades to local-only when a transport doesn't implement it.
  - **Cross-pod live-tail**: the engine now broadcasts lifecycle events, so a dashboard-only pod (`worker: false`) sees events from a run executing on a worker pod. The dashboard exposes `@Sse('runs/:id/stream')` and `durableClient.streamRun(id, onEvent)` — live updates without polling.
  - **Cooperative cancellation**: `engine.cancel(runId)` broadcasts the cancel; `engine.onCancel(fn)` lets a worker bridge abort in-flight work instead of finishing it just to have the result discarded. Events are deduped by originating `instanceId` so a broker echo doesn't double-deliver.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Durability hardening (audit follow-up):
  - **Non-determinism detection**: on resume, a step whose name no longer matches the checkpoint recorded at that logical position throws `NonDeterminismError` instead of silently replaying the wrong checkpoint into the wrong step (the classic way a changed-under-flight workflow corrupts a run).
  - **Deterministic sources**: `ctx.now()`, `ctx.random()`, `ctx.uuid()` — checkpointed once and replayed verbatim, so workflows stop being corrupted by raw `Date.now()`/`Math.random()`/`randomUUID()`.
  - **Retry backoff**: `StepOptions` `backoff: 'fixed' | 'exp'` + `backoffMs`/`backoffMaxMs`/`jitter` is now actually applied between local-step retries (it was declared but ignored).
  - **Cancellation safety**: a cancelled/completed run is no longer re-executed by a late worker result or a duplicate `resume()`.
  - **testing**: `assertReplayable(register, history)` replays a recorded run's history against the current workflow code and throws on divergence — a CI guard that catches non-determinism before deploy.
  - **otel**: failed steps now emit a span (with error status), not just completed ones.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Hardening from review:
  - TypeORM auto-schema now reads the live columns (`information_schema` / `PRAGMA`) and adds only the missing ones, instead of ALTER-and-swallow — a real ALTER failure now surfaces rather than being hidden as a presumed "column already exists".
  - Breakpoint detection keys off the checkpoint's `breakpoint` name (the explicit marker) rather than the incidentally-reused `signal` kind, so `engine.continue` can't be confused by other pending steps.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Step-level observability + breakpoints, as a first-class transport-agnostic, cross-language capability.

  - **Step events**: a step records structured `StepEvent`s — debug/info/warn/error log lines and per-sub-process outcomes (`ok`/`failed`/`skipped`). Local steps get a `StepLogger` (`ctx.step(name, (log) => …)`); remote workers attach the same `StepEvent[]` to their `StepResult` (the Python SDK's `StepContext` is the cross-language twin), so a step that fans out internally — e.g. N parallel p-processes — shows which succeeded, failed, or weren't validated, even when the step itself completes. Events are checkpointed (`StepCheckpoint.events`) and rendered under the step in the dashboard, with at-a-glance sub-process counts on the graph node.
  - **Breakpoints**: `ctx.breakpoint(label?)` pauses a run at a point (a visible `pending` checkpoint, zero compute) until it's resumed from the dashboard's **Continue** button or `engine.continue(runId)`. Gate it on your own config to make breakpoints opt-in per run.
  - **Stores**: added the `events` column to all four adapters. The TypeORM auto-schema is now self-healing — it back-fills additive nullable columns (`input`, `events`, `enqueuedAt`, …) on a table that predates them, so an existing deployment upgrades without a manual migration.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- `ctx.call` now **suspends the run durably** instead of awaiting the worker result in memory. The
  remote step writes a `pending` checkpoint, the run suspends, and the result resumes it on whichever
  engine instance receives it — so a worker/control-plane pod can scale down or crash mid-step without
  losing the run or re-running completed work. This makes `ctx.call` consistent with `ctx.task` /
  `ctx.sleep` (already durable). A step that sets `timeoutMs` keeps the in-memory await + heartbeat path
  (opt-in liveness, single-instance).

  **Breaking:** `engine.start()` / `WorkflowService.start()` now returns `suspended` (not `completed`)
  for a workflow that hits a remote `ctx.call` — the run finishes asynchronously when the result lands.
  Trigger-and-observe consumers are unaffected; anything that awaited `start()` to completion should
  poll the run status (or react to `run.completed`) instead.

  `StepCheckpoint.status` gains `'pending'` (an in-flight remote step), surfaced in the dashboard as a
  "running" node. In-process transports (event-emitter, the in-memory test transport) now deliver
  results on a later tick so the suspend settles first.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Record a step's **input** on its checkpoint, alongside the output. A remote step's `ctx.call` args
  are now persisted and surfaced in the dashboard step panel ("Input" + "Output" shown separately,
  instead of only the output) — so you can see what a step was called with, not just what it returned.
  Stored as a nullable column across all four store adapters; the in-memory store carries it for free.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Add native step timing/status: checkpoints now record `enqueuedAt` (dispatch) →
  `startedAt` (worker pickup) → `finishedAt` (done), so you can see how long a step
  waited in the queue before a worker began processing it (queue-wait =
  `startedAt − enqueuedAt`). The worker's start time flows back through the single
  `runStepHandler` choke point, so every transport reports it for free. A new
  `step.started` event announces a remote step as in-flight, and `step.completed` /
  `step.failed` events carry `queueMs`. The dashboard step panel surfaces the queue
  time alongside the processing duration. Stored as a nullable column with a
  back-compat fallback to `startedAt` for rows written before this release.
