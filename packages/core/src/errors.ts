 * (the decision was dropped by a stall/redelivery or an instance restart spanning the in-memory waiter
 * map). Crucially this is NOT a run failure: the work may have actually completed and only the decision
 * was lost. The engine treats it as RECOVERABLE — it releases the run lease and leaves the run
 * `running` so `recoverIncomplete` re-drives it deterministically (replaying completed steps from
 * history). Distinct from a real executor error, which still fails the run.
 *
 * OPT-IN: only thrown when the executor was constructed with a `timeoutMs`. Absent a timeout, the
 * engine awaits the decision with its prior (unbounded) behavior — so existing users see no change.
 *
 * Known hazard: a timeout that fires while a worker is LEGITIMATELY still executing a not-yet-
 * checkpointed step will re-drive and re-run that in-flight step → DUPLICATE side effects. Therefore
 * the timeout is only safe when set GENEROUSLY (longer than the longest legitimate single turn). The
 * robust fix — a liveness/heartbeat-rearmed deadline so only a genuinely-dead worker re-drives — is the
 * documented follow-up (see the Track A diagnosis doc, "Part B").
