 * Pluggable backend for the remote-step flow-control gate (`ctx.call(step, input, { queue })`). The

 * it when an admitted slot is released.
 *
 * The default {@link InMemoryAdmissionBackend} keeps per-instance counts — correct for a single
 * orchestrator. Swap in a store/Redis-backed backend to make the caps and ordering GLOBAL across
 * engine replicas (so `concurrency: 5` means 5 in-flight across the whole fleet, not 5 per pod).
 *
 * `tryAdmit`/`release` are async so a global backend can do its atomic round-trip; the in-memory one
 * resolves synchronously. An UNREGISTERED queue name is treated as ungated (admits immediately) — the
 * engine only tracks/releases a slot for a registered queue.
