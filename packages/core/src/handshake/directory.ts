/**
 * The workflow directory — {@link ./announced}'s registry plus the thing an empty registry could
 * never say: WHY it is empty.
 *
 * ## The three states an empty list used to collapse
 *
 * "What workflows can I call?" has three honest answers, and returning `[]` for all of them is the
 * bug this module exists to fix. They are not shades of the same answer; they call for three
 * different actions from whoever asked.
 *
 * 1. **This process cannot ask.** No transport here can introspect the advertisement or liveness
 *    keyspace — a pure in-process pool advertises nothing and scans nothing. Workers may well be
 *    running; nobody looked. ({@link WorkflowDirectory.supported} is `false`.) The action is to
 *    configure a transport, or to stop treating this pod's answer as the deployment's answer.
 * 2. **Nothing is live.** The fleet WAS asked and the fleet is empty. ({@link WorkflowDirectory.supported}
 *    is `true`, `workflows` is `[]`.) The action is to start a worker.
 * 3. **Here it is.** ({@link WorkflowDirectory.supported} is `true`, `workflows` is populated.)
 *
 * There is a fourth that hides inside the second and is the most expensive to debug, because it
 * looks exactly like "nobody is running" from the caller's side: **a worker is live on a partition
 * this engine does not serve.** A worker started with a partition consumes `<token>@<partition>`,
 * convention resolution computes the token for THIS engine's namespace, misses, and reports absence.
 * The heartbeat keyspace is shared, so the evidence is right there — and
 * {@link WorkflowDirectory.otherPartitions} reports it instead of letting the caller conclude that
 * nothing exists.
 *
 * ## Why a sentence rides along
 *
 * Every field here is structured and a caller can branch on all of it. {@link WorkflowDirectory.detail}
 * exists anyway because the three states are only useful if the human reading the picker learns which
 * one they are in, and a UI that has to re-derive that prose from booleans will re-derive it
 * differently in each place it is shown. The sentence is written once, next to the logic that decides
 * which state it is.
