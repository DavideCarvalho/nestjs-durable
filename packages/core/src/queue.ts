/**
 * Flow control for remote steps. A queue caps how much work `ctx.call(step, input, { queue })`
 * admits at once — a concurrency limit and/or a fixed-window rate limit. When a call can't be
 * admitted it doesn't dispatch: the run re-suspends with a near-future wake time, and the timer
 * poller re-tries admission later — so flow control is durable (survives crashes) without holding
 * the run in memory.
 *
 * Accounting is per engine instance (the DBOS `workerConcurrency` tier): correct for the common
 * single-orchestrator deployment. Global, cross-instance limits would need a durable counter in the
 * store — a deliberate follow-up, not built here.
 *
 * Beyond raw caps, the controller can admit contended slots by PRIORITY and by per-KEY FAIRNESS
 * (round-robin), so a single noisy key/tenant can't monopolize the concurrency budget. This is the
 * DISPATCH/admission layer — it never touches workflow replay (engine positional logic). Default
 * behaviour is unchanged FIFO when neither priority nor fairness is configured/passed.
 *
 * Design (vs Temporal/Inngest/DBOS): Temporal task queues are FIFO with separate priority levels;
 * Inngest concurrency keys + throttle give per-key fairness; DBOS queues are FIFO with a
 * `workerConcurrency` cap. We fold both knobs into the same in-process admission gate: an optional
 * per-call `priority` (higher first) and an optional queue-level `fairness: 'key'` (round-robin by
 * the per-call `key`). Because blocked calls re-suspend durably and retry independently (there is no
 * resident FIFO list to reorder), the controller remembers the set of WAITERS that asked-and-were-
 * blocked, and on a later retry only admits the one that is rightful-next under the policy.
