## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f1679e5: Typed search attributes — query runs by structured data, not just exact-match tag labels.

  - **Start**: `start(wf, input, id, { searchAttributes: { amount: 200, tier: 'pro' } })` stamps typed, queryable data on a run.
  - **Query**: `RunQuery.attributes` takes `{ key, op, value }` predicates ANDed together, with `eq/ne/gt/gte/lt/lte` — so range queries like `amount >= 200 AND tier = 'pro'` work. Applied in-process after the coarse workflow/status/tag filters, so it's portable across all store adapters (typeorm/prisma/mikro-orm/drizzle gain a `searchAttributes` JSON column).
  - **Dashboard**: an attribute filter box (`amount:gte:200, tier:eq:pro`), attribute pills on the run detail, and bulk retry/cancel honoring the same predicates. API: `GET /runs?attr=key:op:value` (repeatable).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- f2260da: feat: named events — ctx.waitForEvent + engine.publishEvent

  Name-based pub/sub on top of the signal machinery, for choreography beyond point-to-point signals. A
  run suspends on `ctx.waitForEvent('payment.settled', { match: { orderId }, timeoutMs })` and resumes
  with the payload; `engine.publishEvent(name, payload)` (also `WorkflowService.publishEvent`) fans out
  to every waiting run whose `match` the payload satisfies, returning how many it resumed. The match is
  encoded in the waiter token, so the only store change is a new `listSignalWaiters(prefix)` method
  (implemented across in-memory, TypeORM, MikroORM, Prisma, Drizzle) — no new schema.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 685258f: feat: workflow tags + search

  Label runs and search/filter by them in the dashboard. Tags come from two sources, merged onto each
  run:

  - **Static** — `@Workflow({ name: 'pipeline', tags: ['etl', 'critical'] })` stamps every run of the
    workflow.
  - **Per-run** — `WorkflowService.start(wf, input, runId, { tags: ['nightly'] })` (and
    `engine.start(..., { tags })`) adds run-scoped tags.

  `WorkflowRun.tags` is stored across all store adapters (in-memory, TypeORM, MikroORM, Prisma,
  Drizzle), and `RunQuery.tag` filters by an exact tag. The dashboard shows tags on each run (list +
  detail) and adds a tag filter box; clicking a tag filters the list. The dashboard API gains a
  `?tag=` query param.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 6979d60: fix: list runs newest-first

  `store.listRuns` now orders by `createdAt DESC` (was `ASC`) across every adapter (in-memory,
  TypeORM, MikroORM, Prisma, Drizzle), so the dashboard shows the most recent run on top instead of
  buried at the bottom.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3f79533: feat: dead-letter queue — `maxRecoveryAttempts` + `dead` run status

  Crash recovery now counts attempts per run (`WorkflowRun.recoveryAttempts`); once a still-`running`
  run exceeds the engine/module `maxRecoveryAttempts`, it's moved to the new terminal **`dead`** status
  instead of being retried forever — so a poison pill that crashes the process every boot becomes an
  inspectable dead-letter entry, not a crash loop. The new column is persisted by all four store
  adapters (TypeORM auto-schema self-heals it; Prisma/Drizzle/MikroORM schemas updated), and `dead` is
  added to the dashboard/codegen status unions. Omit `maxRecoveryAttempts` for the prior unlimited-retry behaviour.

### Patch Changes

- 9e36ac0: feat: saga compensation retry + visibility, and a dashboard query index

  - **Compensation retry + visibility** — each saga undo is now retried up to `compensationRetries`
    (engine/module option, default 1) and emits a `compensate:<step>` step event for its outcome, so a
    stranded undo shows up in the dashboard/telescope instead of being silently swallowed. A
    permanently-failing compensation is still skipped so it can't mask the original failure.
  - **TypeORM auto-schema index** — adds `(workflow, status)` alongside the existing `(status, wakeAt)`
    index, so the dashboard's `listRuns` filter hits an index.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Hardening from review:
  - TypeORM auto-schema now reads the live columns (`information_schema` / `PRAGMA`) and adds only the missing ones, instead of ALTER-and-swallow — a real ALTER failure now surfaces rather than being hidden as a presumed "column already exists".
  - Breakpoint detection keys off the checkpoint's `breakpoint` name (the explicit marker) rather than the incidentally-reused `signal` kind, so `engine.continue` can't be confused by other pending steps.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Step-level observability + breakpoints, as a first-class transport-agnostic, cross-language capability.

  - **Step events**: a step records structured `StepEvent`s — debug/info/warn/error log lines and per-sub-process outcomes (`ok`/`failed`/`skipped`). Local steps get a `StepLogger` (`ctx.step(name, (log) => …)`); remote workers attach the same `StepEvent[]` to their `StepResult` (the Python SDK's `StepContext` is the cross-language twin), so a step that fans out internally — e.g. N parallel p-processes — shows which succeeded, failed, or weren't validated, even when the step itself completes. Events are checkpointed (`StepCheckpoint.events`) and rendered under the step in the dashboard, with at-a-glance sub-process counts on the graph node.
  - **Breakpoints**: `ctx.breakpoint(label?)` pauses a run at a point (a visible `pending` checkpoint, zero compute) until it's resumed from the dashboard's **Continue** button or `engine.continue(runId)`. Gate it on your own config to make breakpoints opt-in per run.
  - **Stores**: added the `events` column to all four adapters. The TypeORM auto-schema is now self-healing — it back-fills additive nullable columns (`input`, `events`, `enqueuedAt`, …) on a table that predates them, so an existing deployment upgrades without a manual migration.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- `ctx.call` now **suspends the run durably** instead of awaiting the worker result in memory. The
  remote step writes a `pending` checkpoint, the run suspends, and the result resumes it on whichever
  engine instance receives it — so a worker/control-plane pod can scale down or crash mid-step without
  losing the run or re-running completed work. This makes `ctx.call` consistent with `ctx.task` /
  `ctx.sleep` (already durable). A step that sets `timeoutMs` keeps the in-memory await + heartbeat path
  (opt-in liveness, single-instance).

  **Breaking:** `engine.start()` / `WorkflowService.start()` now returns `suspended` (not `completed`)
  for a workflow that hits a remote `ctx.call` — the run finishes asynchronously when the result lands.
  Trigger-and-observe consumers are unaffected; anything that awaited `start()` to completion should
  poll the run status (or react to `run.completed`) instead.

  `StepCheckpoint.status` gains `'pending'` (an in-flight remote step), surfaced in the dashboard as a
  "running" node. In-process transports (event-emitter, the in-memory test transport) now deliver
  results on a later tick so the suspend settles first.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Record a step's **input** on its checkpoint, alongside the output. A remote step's `ctx.call` args
  are now persisted and surfaced in the dashboard step panel ("Input" + "Output" shown separately,
  instead of only the output) — so you can see what a step was called with, not just what it returned.
  Stored as a nullable column across all four store adapters; the in-memory store carries it for free.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Add native step timing/status: checkpoints now record `enqueuedAt` (dispatch) →
  `startedAt` (worker pickup) → `finishedAt` (done), so you can see how long a step
  waited in the queue before a worker began processing it (queue-wait =
  `startedAt − enqueuedAt`). The worker's start time flows back through the single
  `runStepHandler` choke point, so every transport reports it for free. A new
  `step.started` event announces a remote step as in-flight, and `step.completed` /
  `step.failed` events carry `queueMs`. The dashboard step panel surfaces the queue
  time alongside the processing duration. Stored as a nullable column with a
  back-compat fallback to `startedAt` for rows written before this release.
