## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Hardening from review:
  - TypeORM auto-schema now reads the live columns (`information_schema` / `PRAGMA`) and adds only the missing ones, instead of ALTER-and-swallow — a real ALTER failure now surfaces rather than being hidden as a presumed "column already exists".
  - Breakpoint detection keys off the checkpoint's `breakpoint` name (the explicit marker) rather than the incidentally-reused `signal` kind, so `engine.continue` can't be confused by other pending steps.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Step-level observability + breakpoints, as a first-class transport-agnostic, cross-language capability.

  - **Step events**: a step records structured `StepEvent`s — debug/info/warn/error log lines and per-sub-process outcomes (`ok`/`failed`/`skipped`). Local steps get a `StepLogger` (`ctx.step(name, (log) => …)`); remote workers attach the same `StepEvent[]` to their `StepResult` (the Python SDK's `StepContext` is the cross-language twin), so a step that fans out internally — e.g. N parallel p-processes — shows which succeeded, failed, or weren't validated, even when the step itself completes. Events are checkpointed (`StepCheckpoint.events`) and rendered under the step in the dashboard, with at-a-glance sub-process counts on the graph node.
  - **Breakpoints**: `ctx.breakpoint(label?)` pauses a run at a point (a visible `pending` checkpoint, zero compute) until it's resumed from the dashboard's **Continue** button or `engine.continue(runId)`. Gate it on your own config to make breakpoints opt-in per run.
  - **Stores**: added the `events` column to all four adapters. The TypeORM auto-schema is now self-healing — it back-fills additive nullable columns (`input`, `events`, `enqueuedAt`, …) on a table that predates them, so an existing deployment upgrades without a manual migration.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- `ctx.call` now **suspends the run durably** instead of awaiting the worker result in memory. The
  remote step writes a `pending` checkpoint, the run suspends, and the result resumes it on whichever
  engine instance receives it — so a worker/control-plane pod can scale down or crash mid-step without
  losing the run or re-running completed work. This makes `ctx.call` consistent with `ctx.task` /
  `ctx.sleep` (already durable). A step that sets `timeoutMs` keeps the in-memory await + heartbeat path
  (opt-in liveness, single-instance).

  **Breaking:** `engine.start()` / `WorkflowService.start()` now returns `suspended` (not `completed`)
  for a workflow that hits a remote `ctx.call` — the run finishes asynchronously when the result lands.
  Trigger-and-observe consumers are unaffected; anything that awaited `start()` to completion should
  poll the run status (or react to `run.completed`) instead.

  `StepCheckpoint.status` gains `'pending'` (an in-flight remote step), surfaced in the dashboard as a
  "running" node. In-process transports (event-emitter, the in-memory test transport) now deliver
  results on a later tick so the suspend settles first.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Record a step's **input** on its checkpoint, alongside the output. A remote step's `ctx.call` args
  are now persisted and surfaced in the dashboard step panel ("Input" + "Output" shown separately,
  instead of only the output) — so you can see what a step was called with, not just what it returned.
  Stored as a nullable column across all four store adapters; the in-memory store carries it for free.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Add native step timing/status: checkpoints now record `enqueuedAt` (dispatch) →
  `startedAt` (worker pickup) → `finishedAt` (done), so you can see how long a step
  waited in the queue before a worker began processing it (queue-wait =
  `startedAt − enqueuedAt`). The worker's start time flows back through the single
  `runStepHandler` choke point, so every transport reports it for free. A new
  `step.started` event announces a remote step as in-flight, and `step.completed` /
  `step.failed` events carry `queueMs`. The dashboard step panel surfaces the queue
  time alongside the processing duration. Stored as a nullable column with a
  back-compat fallback to `startedAt` for rows written before this release.
