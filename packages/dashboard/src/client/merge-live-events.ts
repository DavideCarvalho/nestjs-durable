/**
 * Merge a freshly-fetched run with the previously-cached one, preserving the live event trail the SSE
 * stream accumulated for in-flight steps.
 *
 * The store only persists a step's `events` at COMPLETION, so a poll/refetch returns a still-running
 * step with empty `events`. The live-tail (`step.progress`) appends events into the cache as they
 * arrive; replacing the cache wholesale on every 1.5s refetch would wipe that streamed trail — it
 * then reappears on the next stream event, so sub-processes flicker (appear → vanish → reappear).
 *
 * Rule: a step still `pending`/`running` with no fetched events keeps the streamed copy; a
 * `completed`/`failed` step is authoritative and always uses the fetched events (even if empty).
