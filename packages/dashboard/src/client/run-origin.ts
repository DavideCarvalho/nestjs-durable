 *  - `all` — the DEFAULT. Every origin, attributed or not. Core's `RunQuery.origin` docblock is
 *    explicit that a facet built on it must keep this option, because an exact-match origin filter
 *    hides every unattributed run.
 *  - `origin` — one concrete package (`@dudousxd/nestjs-catalog-pipeline`).
 *  - `unknown` — runs with NO recorded origin. `RunQuery.origin` is an exact-match string and so
 *    cannot express "absent", which is exactly why this case is applied here, over the run list the
 *    console already holds, instead of being pushed down to the store.
