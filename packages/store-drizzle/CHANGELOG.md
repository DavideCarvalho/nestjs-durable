## 0.10.3

### Patch Changes

- 99e78fb: Remote `startChild` / `gather_children` child-await `signal:child:` checkpoints now carry the command's `parallelGroup`. The fan group is threaded `command → signal waiter → checkpoint`: the engine stamps each child waiter with the awaiting `startChild` command's group, and the resolving `signal:child:<id>` checkpoint (written when the child notifies the parent) inherits it. Each store adapter persists a nullable `parallel_group` column on the signal-waiter row so it round-trips `put → take`. As a result the dashboard renders a cross-SDK parallel child fan-out (e.g. a Python `ctx.gather_children`) stacked vertically as one parallel group instead of a misleading horizontal `start → s1 → … → sN → end` sequential chain. Additive and backward-compatible: existing waiter rows simply have a NULL group.

## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- 1738393: Persist `parallelGroup` on step checkpoints (parity with the mikro-orm adapter). A `ctx.gather`/`ctx.all` fan tags every sibling step with the same group so the dashboard renders them as one "ran in parallel" group, and the core engine carries it (including from a remote/polyglot worker's `recordStep`) — but these adapters had no column for it, so it was dropped on insert and read back as `undefined`, leaving the fan rendered as N sequential rows. Adds a nullable `parallel_group` column to the checkpoint table and maps it in both directions.

  - **typeorm**: auto-added on boot by `ensureTypeOrmDurableSchema` (no manual migration).
  - **drizzle / prisma**: the column is added to the schema/model; consumers manage their own schema, so apply a migration adding the nullable `parallel_group` column (e.g. `prisma migrate` / a drizzle migration). The reference `schema.prisma` now includes it.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- c1aaacd: Add a transient `cancelling` run status so a compensating cancel is visible (and durable) instead of looking like a still-`running` run.

  **core:** `RunStatus` gains a non-terminal `'cancelling'`. `cancel(runId, { compensate: true })` now persists `cancelling` immediately (and returns it) while the background saga undo runs, then flips to `cancelled` — previously the run stayed `running`/`suspended` with no outward signal that a cancel was in flight. A repeat compensating cancel is idempotent. The status is treated as in-flight everywhere it must be: the singleton admission gate counts it, and recovery re-drives it — so a crash mid-compensation re-derives the cancel intent from the persisted status and finishes the cancel (a compensating cancel is now crash-durable). A non-compensating `cancel()` is unchanged (straight to `cancelled`). For a remote/polyglot workflow (no TS-side compensations) a `cancelling` run finalizes deterministically to `cancelled`.

  **stores (mikro-orm / typeorm / prisma / drizzle):** `listIncompleteRuns()` now also returns `cancelling` runs so recovery re-drives a compensation interrupted by a crash. Columns are free strings — no migration.

  **dashboard / telescope:** render `cancelling` with a distinct in-progress amber (it pulses like a live run; distinct from the grey terminal `cancelled`), add it to the status filter and the state-breakdown chart.

  **codegen:** generated run-status union types include `'cancelling'`.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- f273457: Dispatch priority now reaches the broker, end-to-end.

  - `ctx.call(step, input, { priority })` and `ctx.child(workflow, input, { priority })` carry their
    priority onto the dispatched `RemoteTask` / `WorkflowTask`. The third arg of `ctx.child` /
    `ctx.startChild` accepts `{ childId?, priority? }` (a bare string is still shorthand for `childId`).
  - The BullMQ transport forwards that priority to the job's `priority` option, translating the
    engine's "higher = more urgent" scale onto BullMQ's inverse "lower = more urgent" so one convention
    holds end-to-end. Jobs without a priority keep the FIFO default path.
  - `WorkflowRun.priority` is persisted by every store adapter (MikroORM, Drizzle, TypeORM, Prisma) so
    the priority survives the store round-trip that precedes each remote-workflow advance. Additive,
    nullable column — auto-schema/self-heal adds it to existing tables.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 39812a2: Add `deleteRun` to hard-delete a run and its rows.

  New `StateStore.deleteRun(runId)` removes a run plus its checkpoints, signal waiters, and normalized search-attribute rows — implemented in the in-memory store and all four ORM adapters (mikro-orm, typeorm, prisma, drizzle), forwarded by `CodecStateStore`, and covered by the shared store conformance contract. `WorkflowEngine.deleteRun(runId)` builds on it to hard-delete a run and cascade depth-first to its whole subtree (via `getRunChildren`), returning the number of runs removed.

  Unlike `cancel` (which marks a run `cancelled` but keeps it as history), `deleteRun` REMOVES the run — it no longer appears in `getRun`/`listRuns`. Intended for purging a finished run whose data is being deleted; prefer `cancel` first for a live run.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 6f4e59e: Fix: map every patchable field in the Prisma and Drizzle `updateRun` implementations (previously a subset of fields could be silently dropped on partial updates).

  Internal engine refactors (behavior-preserving): extract `SingletonGate` to concentrate the singleton feature, funnel run settle/suspend transitions through a single `settleRun()`, and extract a `stepCheckpoint()` factory deduping 8 hand-built literals.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- b7267da: perf: `getEvent` and `getRunChildren` use targeted store queries instead of fetching and JS-filtering every checkpoint for a run. Adds two **optional** `StateStore` methods (`getLatestCheckpointByName`, `listCheckpointsByNamePrefix`) implemented by all first-party adapters; the engine falls back to the previous `listCheckpoints` scan when a custom store omits them, so this is non-breaking. Cuts per-call rows fetched from O(N) to O(1)/O(k).

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 687face: Ecosystem improvements across the durable runtime, stores, transports, and tooling.

  ### Scheduling

  - **Schedule jitter + backfill.** Cron/interval schedules can now spread fire
    times with configurable jitter to avoid thundering-herd dispatch, and missed
    occurrences (e.g. while a worker was down) can be backfilled deterministically.

  ### Cancellation

  - **Cancel-by-event.** New `cancelWhere(filter)` cancels all matching runs by a
    declarative filter, complementing single-run cancellation.

  ### Search attributes

  - **Indexed search-attribute side-table pushdown.** Equality and range queries
    over search attributes are pushed down into an indexed side-table across every
    store — TypeORM, MikroORM, Prisma, Drizzle, and the in-memory store — instead
    of scanning and filtering in application code. The side-table is re-indexed on
    update so stale attribute values stop matching.

  ### Singleton admission

  - **Backpressure + notify-on-release + `maxQueueDepth`.** Singleton admission now
    applies backpressure with a configurable `maxQueueDepth`, and waiters are
    notified on release rather than polling.

  ### Queue

  - **Priority + per-key fairness.** The work queue supports per-message priority
    together with per-key fairness so that one busy key cannot starve others.

  ### Context propagation

  - **Opaque context carrier.** Context is now propagated through an opaque carrier,
    decoupling callers from the underlying transport/trace representation.

  ### Packaging

  - **Dual ESM/CJS publish.** Packages now ship both ESM and CJS builds. Decorator
    packages are built via SWC with `legacyDecorator` + `decoratorMetadata` to
    preserve emitted metadata; `testing`, `cli`, and `eslint-plugin` remain
    CJS/ESM as appropriate by design.

  ### Testing

  - **Testcontainers-backed integration specs.** BullMQ, SQS, DB, and Prisma now
    have testcontainers-backed integration specs that run under `test:db`, plus a
    fix to the BullMQ dispatch test shape.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- dc5e0f6: Exactly-once transactional steps — `ctx.transaction(name, (tx) => ...)`.

  Runs your DB work and the step's checkpoint in **one** store transaction, so the business write and the "done" marker commit atomically — a crash can never leave the write done-but-not-checkpointed (which a plain `ctx.step` re-runs on recovery). `tx` is the store-native transaction handle (a TypeORM/MikroORM `EntityManager`, a Prisma tx client, or a Drizzle tx); do your writes on it. Needs a SQL store (all bundled SQL adapters implement the new optional `StateStore.transaction`); errors on a store without it. This is the DBOS-style exactly-once guarantee for same-database work.

- 8ba981d: Signal-with-start (durable entities), cancel→child propagation, and low-latency dispatch.

  - **Reliable signals + `signalWithStart`**: a signal sent with no waiter is now **buffered** (FIFO per token) and delivered to the next `waitForSignal` — signals are never lost to timing. `engine.signalWithStart(workflow, input, runId, { token, payload })` / `workflowService.signalWithStart(...)` ensures a run exists then delivers a signal, race-free — the canonical **durable-entity / accumulator** pattern (one long-lived run per key fed events by many calls). New `StateStore.bufferSignal` / `takeBufferedSignal` (custom stores must add them; all bundled adapters do).
  - **Cancellation cascades to children**: `engine.cancel(parent)` now cancels the runs it started via `ctx.child` / `ctx.startChild` (recursively), and no longer clobbers an already-finished run.
  - **Low-latency cross-pod dispatch**: a run enqueued on one instance (e.g. an API pod) nudges worker instances over the control plane (`engine.onEnqueued`) to pick it up at once instead of on the next poll. The dashboard `/metrics` adds `durable_pending_runs` (dispatch backlog) + `durable_dead_runs` (DLQ size) gauges.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- c99508d: Self-healing recovery + non-blocking dashboard actions.

  - **Lease renewal**: while a run executes, the engine renews its recovery lease (every `leaseMs/2`), so a live worker keeps a long run while a **crashed** worker's lease still expires. `execute` now holds the lease for the whole run on every entry path (sweep, signal, remote result, dashboard), so a run is never double-executed. New `StateStore.renewRunLock(runId, owner, leaseUntilMs)` — **custom stores must add it**.
  - **Periodic orphan recovery**: the NestJS `TimerPoller` now calls `engine.recoverIncomplete()` each tick, so a run orphaned by a crashed worker self-heals within ~`leaseMs` instead of only on the next boot.
  - **Non-blocking control actions** (fixes the `/durable` retry/cancel request hanging): `retry` now re-enqueues via the new `engine.requeue(runId)` (sets `pending` + dispatches) and `cancel({ compensate })` runs the undo in the background — neither replays the workflow inline in the HTTP request anymore. A worker does the work.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- a5fd901: Typed search attributes — query runs by structured data, not just exact-match tag labels.

  - **Start**: `start(wf, input, id, { searchAttributes: { amount: 200, tier: 'pro' } })` stamps typed, queryable data on a run.
  - **Query**: `RunQuery.attributes` takes `{ key, op, value }` predicates ANDed together, with `eq/ne/gt/gte/lt/lte` — so range queries like `amount >= 200 AND tier = 'pro'` work. Applied in-process after the coarse workflow/status/tag filters, so it's portable across all store adapters (typeorm/prisma/mikro-orm/drizzle gain a `searchAttributes` JSON column).
  - **Dashboard**: an attribute filter box (`amount:gte:200, tier:eq:pro`), attribute pills on the run detail, and bulk retry/cancel honoring the same predicates. API: `GET /runs?attr=key:op:value` (repeatable).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- f2260da: feat: named events — ctx.waitForEvent + engine.publishEvent

  Name-based pub/sub on top of the signal machinery, for choreography beyond point-to-point signals. A
  run suspends on `ctx.waitForEvent('payment.settled', { match: { orderId }, timeoutMs })` and resumes
  with the payload; `engine.publishEvent(name, payload)` (also `WorkflowService.publishEvent`) fans out
  to every waiting run whose `match` the payload satisfies, returning how many it resumed. The match is
  encoded in the waiter token, so the only store change is a new `listSignalWaiters(prefix)` method
  (implemented across in-memory, TypeORM, MikroORM, Prisma, Drizzle) — no new schema.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 685258f: feat: workflow tags + search

  Label runs and search/filter by them in the dashboard. Tags come from two sources, merged onto each
  run:

  - **Static** — `@Workflow({ name: 'pipeline', tags: ['etl', 'critical'] })` stamps every run of the
    workflow.
  - **Per-run** — `WorkflowService.start(wf, input, runId, { tags: ['nightly'] })` (and
    `engine.start(..., { tags })`) adds run-scoped tags.

  `WorkflowRun.tags` is stored across all store adapters (in-memory, TypeORM, MikroORM, Prisma,
  Drizzle), and `RunQuery.tag` filters by an exact tag. The dashboard shows tags on each run (list +
  detail) and adds a tag filter box; clicking a tag filters the list. The dashboard API gains a
  `?tag=` query param.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 6979d60: fix: list runs newest-first

  `store.listRuns` now orders by `createdAt DESC` (was `ASC`) across every adapter (in-memory,
  TypeORM, MikroORM, Prisma, Drizzle), so the dashboard shows the most recent run on top instead of
  buried at the bottom.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3f79533: feat: dead-letter queue — `maxRecoveryAttempts` + `dead` run status

  Crash recovery now counts attempts per run (`WorkflowRun.recoveryAttempts`); once a still-`running`
  run exceeds the engine/module `maxRecoveryAttempts`, it's moved to the new terminal **`dead`** status
  instead of being retried forever — so a poison pill that crashes the process every boot becomes an
  inspectable dead-letter entry, not a crash loop. The new column is persisted by all four store
  adapters (TypeORM auto-schema self-heals it; Prisma/Drizzle/MikroORM schemas updated), and `dead` is
  added to the dashboard/codegen status unions. Omit `maxRecoveryAttempts` for the prior unlimited-retry behaviour.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Step-level observability + breakpoints, as a first-class transport-agnostic, cross-language capability.

  - **Step events**: a step records structured `StepEvent`s — debug/info/warn/error log lines and per-sub-process outcomes (`ok`/`failed`/`skipped`). Local steps get a `StepLogger` (`ctx.step(name, (log) => …)`); remote workers attach the same `StepEvent[]` to their `StepResult` (the Python SDK's `StepContext` is the cross-language twin), so a step that fans out internally — e.g. N parallel p-processes — shows which succeeded, failed, or weren't validated, even when the step itself completes. Events are checkpointed (`StepCheckpoint.events`) and rendered under the step in the dashboard, with at-a-glance sub-process counts on the graph node.
  - **Breakpoints**: `ctx.breakpoint(label?)` pauses a run at a point (a visible `pending` checkpoint, zero compute) until it's resumed from the dashboard's **Continue** button or `engine.continue(runId)`. Gate it on your own config to make breakpoints opt-in per run.
  - **Stores**: added the `events` column to all four adapters. The TypeORM auto-schema is now self-healing — it back-fills additive nullable columns (`input`, `events`, `enqueuedAt`, …) on a table that predates them, so an existing deployment upgrades without a manual migration.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Record a step's **input** on its checkpoint, alongside the output. A remote step's `ctx.call` args
  are now persisted and surfaced in the dashboard step panel ("Input" + "Output" shown separately,
  instead of only the output) — so you can see what a step was called with, not just what it returned.
  Stored as a nullable column across all four store adapters; the in-memory store carries it for free.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Add native step timing/status: checkpoints now record `enqueuedAt` (dispatch) →
  `startedAt` (worker pickup) → `finishedAt` (done), so you can see how long a step
  waited in the queue before a worker began processing it (queue-wait =
  `startedAt − enqueuedAt`). The worker's start time flows back through the single
  `runStepHandler` choke point, so every transport reports it for free. A new
  `step.started` event announces a remote step as in-flight, and `step.completed` /
  `step.failed` events carry `queueMs`. The dashboard step panel surfaces the queue
  time alongside the processing duration. Stored as a nullable column with a
  back-compat fallback to `startedAt` for rows written before this release.
