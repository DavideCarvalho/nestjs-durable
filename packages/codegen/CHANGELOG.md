## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3f79533: feat: dead-letter queue — `maxRecoveryAttempts` + `dead` run status

  Crash recovery now counts attempts per run (`WorkflowRun.recoveryAttempts`); once a still-`running`
  run exceeds the engine/module `maxRecoveryAttempts`, it's moved to the new terminal **`dead`** status
  instead of being retried forever — so a poison pill that crashes the process every boot becomes an
  inspectable dead-letter entry, not a crash loop. The new column is persisted by all four store
  adapters (TypeORM auto-schema self-heals it; Prisma/Drizzle/MikroORM schemas updated), and `dead` is
  added to the dashboard/codegen status unions. Omit `maxRecoveryAttempts` for the prior unlimited-retry behaviour.

- 9c4a3cf: feat: durable webhooks (`ctx.webhook()`)

  A first-class, replay-safe "expose a callback URL and wait for it" primitive. `ctx.webhook()` mints
  a deterministic token (`wh:<runId>:<seq>`) and — when the engine has a `webhookUrl` builder — a
  public `url` to hand a third party inside a step; `await handle.wait()` then suspends with zero
  compute until the callback arrives. The dashboard exposes `POST webhooks/:token` (turning the inbound
  POST into `engine.signal`), the NestJS module gains a `webhookUrl` option, and the codegen extension
  emits the `deliverWebhook` (and the previously-missing `continue`) route into the typed client.

- f915e2c: feat: synchronous queries & validated updates

  Two Temporal-style primitives adapted to the suspend/checkpoint model:

  - **Query** — `ctx.setEvent(key, value)` publishes a named, replay-safe value; `engine.getEvent(runId, key)`
    reads the latest value of a live (or finished) run with no side effect. Exposed as
    `GET runs/:id/events/:key`.
  - **Update** — `ctx.onUpdate(name)` is a run-scoped update point; `engine.update(runId, name, arg)`
    delivers to it, gated by a validator registered with `engine.registerUpdateValidator(workflow, name, fn)`
    that can **reject before the run is touched** (`{ accepted: false, reason }`). Exposed as
    `POST runs/:id/updates/:name`. The codegen extension emits both routes into the typed client.

### Patch Changes

- 0900830: feat: compensating cancellation — `engine.cancel(runId, { compensate: true })`

  Cancelling a run can now undo its saga first: the suspended run is resumed with a cancellation
  pending, so replay re-registers the saga and its completed steps' compensations run in reverse
  (visible as `compensate:<step>` events) before the run is marked cancelled. Plain `cancel()` is
  unchanged (immediate, no undo). The dashboard's cancel accepts `?compensate=true`
  (`durableClient.cancel(id, { compensate: true })`), and the codegen client exposes the flag.
