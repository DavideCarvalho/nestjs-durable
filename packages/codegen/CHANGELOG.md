## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- c1aaacd: Add a transient `cancelling` run status so a compensating cancel is visible (and durable) instead of looking like a still-`running` run.

  **core:** `RunStatus` gains a non-terminal `'cancelling'`. `cancel(runId, { compensate: true })` now persists `cancelling` immediately (and returns it) while the background saga undo runs, then flips to `cancelled` — previously the run stayed `running`/`suspended` with no outward signal that a cancel was in flight. A repeat compensating cancel is idempotent. The status is treated as in-flight everywhere it must be: the singleton admission gate counts it, and recovery re-drives it — so a crash mid-compensation re-derives the cancel intent from the persisted status and finishes the cancel (a compensating cancel is now crash-durable). A non-compensating `cancel()` is unchanged (straight to `cancelled`). For a remote/polyglot workflow (no TS-side compensations) a `cancelling` run finalizes deterministically to `cancelled`.

  **stores (mikro-orm / typeorm / prisma / drizzle):** `listIncompleteRuns()` now also returns `cancelling` runs so recovery re-drives a compensation interrupted by a crash. Columns are free strings — no migration.

  **dashboard / telescope:** render `cancelling` with a distinct in-progress amber (it pulses like a live run; distinct from the grey terminal `cancelled`), add it to the status filter and the state-breakdown chart.

  **codegen:** generated run-status union types include `'cancelling'`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 687face: Ecosystem improvements across the durable runtime, stores, transports, and tooling.

  ### Scheduling

  - **Schedule jitter + backfill.** Cron/interval schedules can now spread fire
    times with configurable jitter to avoid thundering-herd dispatch, and missed
    occurrences (e.g. while a worker was down) can be backfilled deterministically.

  ### Cancellation

  - **Cancel-by-event.** New `cancelWhere(filter)` cancels all matching runs by a
    declarative filter, complementing single-run cancellation.

  ### Search attributes

  - **Indexed search-attribute side-table pushdown.** Equality and range queries
    over search attributes are pushed down into an indexed side-table across every
    store — TypeORM, MikroORM, Prisma, Drizzle, and the in-memory store — instead
    of scanning and filtering in application code. The side-table is re-indexed on
    update so stale attribute values stop matching.

  ### Singleton admission

  - **Backpressure + notify-on-release + `maxQueueDepth`.** Singleton admission now
    applies backpressure with a configurable `maxQueueDepth`, and waiters are
    notified on release rather than polling.

  ### Queue

  - **Priority + per-key fairness.** The work queue supports per-message priority
    together with per-key fairness so that one busy key cannot starve others.

  ### Context propagation

  - **Opaque context carrier.** Context is now propagated through an opaque carrier,
    decoupling callers from the underlying transport/trace representation.

  ### Packaging

  - **Dual ESM/CJS publish.** Packages now ship both ESM and CJS builds. Decorator
    packages are built via SWC with `legacyDecorator` + `decoratorMetadata` to
    preserve emitted metadata; `testing`, `cli`, and `eslint-plugin` remain
    CJS/ESM as appropriate by design.

  ### Testing

  - **Testcontainers-backed integration specs.** BullMQ, SQS, DB, and Prisma now
    have testcontainers-backed integration specs that run under `test:db`, plus a
    fix to the BullMQ dispatch test shape.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3f79533: feat: dead-letter queue — `maxRecoveryAttempts` + `dead` run status

  Crash recovery now counts attempts per run (`WorkflowRun.recoveryAttempts`); once a still-`running`
  run exceeds the engine/module `maxRecoveryAttempts`, it's moved to the new terminal **`dead`** status
  instead of being retried forever — so a poison pill that crashes the process every boot becomes an
  inspectable dead-letter entry, not a crash loop. The new column is persisted by all four store
  adapters (TypeORM auto-schema self-heals it; Prisma/Drizzle/MikroORM schemas updated), and `dead` is
  added to the dashboard/codegen status unions. Omit `maxRecoveryAttempts` for the prior unlimited-retry behaviour.

- 9c4a3cf: feat: durable webhooks (`ctx.webhook()`)

  A first-class, replay-safe "expose a callback URL and wait for it" primitive. `ctx.webhook()` mints
  a deterministic token (`wh:<runId>:<seq>`) and — when the engine has a `webhookUrl` builder — a
  public `url` to hand a third party inside a step; `await handle.wait()` then suspends with zero
  compute until the callback arrives. The dashboard exposes `POST webhooks/:token` (turning the inbound
  POST into `engine.signal`), the NestJS module gains a `webhookUrl` option, and the codegen extension
  emits the `deliverWebhook` (and the previously-missing `continue`) route into the typed client.

- f915e2c: feat: synchronous queries & validated updates

  Two Temporal-style primitives adapted to the suspend/checkpoint model:

  - **Query** — `ctx.setEvent(key, value)` publishes a named, replay-safe value; `engine.getEvent(runId, key)`
    reads the latest value of a live (or finished) run with no side effect. Exposed as
    `GET runs/:id/events/:key`.
  - **Update** — `ctx.onUpdate(name)` is a run-scoped update point; `engine.update(runId, name, arg)`
    delivers to it, gated by a validator registered with `engine.registerUpdateValidator(workflow, name, fn)`
    that can **reject before the run is touched** (`{ accepted: false, reason }`). Exposed as
    `POST runs/:id/updates/:name`. The codegen extension emits both routes into the typed client.

### Patch Changes

- 0900830: feat: compensating cancellation — `engine.cancel(runId, { compensate: true })`

  Cancelling a run can now undo its saga first: the suspended run is resumed with a cancellation
  pending, so replay re-registers the saga and its completed steps' compensations run in reverse
  (visible as `compensate:<step>` events) before the run is marked cancelled. Plain `cancel()` is
  unchanged (immediate, no undo). The dashboard's cancel accepts `?compensate=true`
  (`durableClient.cancel(id, { compensate: true })`), and the codegen client exposes the flag.
